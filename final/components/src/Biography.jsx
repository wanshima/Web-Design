            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>
                Vincent van Gogh, born on March 30, 1853, in the Netherlands, is one of the most 
                famous figures in the history of Western art. Though he did not start painting until 
                his late twenties, over the course of his decade-long career, he produced more than 
                2,100 artworks, consisting of around 860 oil paintings and more than 1,300 watercolors, 
                drawings, sketches, and prints.

            <p>
                His work, notable for its beauty, emotion, and color, highly influenced 20th-century 
                art. Van Gogh struggled with mental illness throughout his life, and remained poor and 
                virtually unknown throughout his life. Today, however, his paintings are some of the 
                most well known and expensive works in the world.
            </p>
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Van Gogh was the eldest son of Theodorus van Gogh, a pastor in the Dutch Reformed Church, 
                and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. His early life was characterized by a moody temperament and 
                solitary habits. He worked at an art dealership in The Hague, but became depressed after 
                being transferred to London. This led to his dismissal and a series of unsatisfactory jobs, 
                further deepening his depressive state.
            </p>
            <h2>Artistic Career</h2>
            <p>
                Van Gogh's artistic career is marked by his vivid color choices and emotional depth, 
                particularly during his period in Arles, France, where he created many of his best-known 
                works. Unfortunately, his mental health declined and his death on July 29, 1890, is widely 
                believed to have been a suicide.
            </p>
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                Today, Vincent van Gogh's works are celebrated for their emotional honesty and bold color. 
                His influence on Expressionism, Fauvism, and early abstraction was profound, and his techniques 
                and style remain influential in modern art.
